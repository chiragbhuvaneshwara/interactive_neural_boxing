#Punch label generation using Blender

1. ```analyze``` folder contains code to get the statistics i.e punch durations. Can be executed as:

    ``python -m data.raw_data.punch_label_gen.analyze.stats``
    
    The above script requires punch labels to be generated and stored in ``punch_label`` folder by the blender code in
    ``preprocess`` folder.
    
2. ```preprocess``` folder contains blender code to pre-process the mocap data and generate the punch labels.

3. ``punch_label`` folder contains the punch labels generated by the blender code in ``preprocess`` folder.
